Figma Plugin


Notes for steve:

1. Speak to steve regarding logging in and authentication. (seperate account? or user login..... whats preferred?)
2. Time it takes to load (This is a massive issue most GET requests take 2-4 minutes)
3. Results handling - When it searches GOing to need a indicator that it is loading data for the duration, when it gets the results if over how many there are and a escape to load. some form of handling for the user what is the max you want to load on plugin window.
4. Look into why the new urlparam syntax is causing a extra = on the end of the query string which i believe to be why we are not filtering correctly.
