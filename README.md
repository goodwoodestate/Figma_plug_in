Notes for steve:

1. Speak to steve regarding logging in and authentication.
2. Time it takes to load
3. Results handling - When it searches GOing to need a indicator that it is loading data for the duration, when it gets the results if over how many there are and a escape to load. some form of handling for the user
4. Look into why the new urlparam syntax is causing a extra = on the end of the query string which i believe to be why we are throwing the issue
